## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated orange (#FFA500) to align with the dog theme in the reference image and to evoke playfulness. This is slightly desaturated and darkened for the background.
- Background color: Desaturated orange (#362D22) for overall warmth and visual grounding, as it does not draw attention to itself.
- Accent color: Analogous Yellow (#FFD700) is used for interactive elements to grab attention, and creates a more upbeat feel to the interface.
- Body and headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a modern and techy look. Its neutrality won't clash with the content or meme-focused design.
- Custom, high-quality meme-inspired icons and graphics that react to user interactions and gamified progress.
- Responsive design with clear calls to action and intuitive navigation.
- Interactive elements with hover effects, click animations, and sound effects to provide immediate feedback.
